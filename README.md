# pavlovVrStats-RCON-nodejs
Gets the current status of your servers via RCON, and scrappes mod.io to get the link of the map name and image.

```npm i``` to install packages
```npm run start``` to try it out

create an ```.env``` file beforehand

If you plan to use it, it would be cool to credit my work and/or add my pavlov servers link [Vanguard Force](https://vanguardforce.net/) near this data on your Pavlov website
